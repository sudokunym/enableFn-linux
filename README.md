# enableFn-linux

Commands to enable the 'fn' key in linux.
I use a 60% keyboard and saw other people having issue with this, re-maping, and running around a lot. But I found a [post](https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2018/02/enable-fn-keys-hp-ubuntu-16-04/amp/) from 2018 that worked and it was much simpler than many other alternatives I saw.
I'm currently using Fedora 35, but the publication mentioned is for Ubuntu, so you'll probably see little worded differences.
